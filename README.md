## Mods, Just right
A modpack is not merely a collection of mods piled high. It is only when seen as a harmonious unity, meticulously balanced, that it can unleash incredible magic.**「Harvista」**, with a careful selection of 124 mods, not a single one more or less, hits the sweet spot—enriching the gaming experience while ensuring optimization and balance, painting a pastoral idyll unique to **「Harvista」**.

## Nature
The greatest joy on a journey is often found in the high mountains and flowing waters, the birds and blossoms, the wind and moon. Natural wonders and scenic beauty have long flowed through the verses of scholars and poets, rising and falling in the ancient ballads of civilization's dawn. With the enhancement of Mystic's Biomes and Biome Makeover, **「Harvista」** offers a rich tapestry of diverse and picturesque biomes. From towering mountains to the delicate flowers on the branches, it provides a leisurely and carefree journey. Additionally,**「Harvista」** incorporates Earth Mobs and Naturalist mods, introducing many lively and adorable animal companions, breathing more life into the original natural world. When you grow weary of the mundane routines of daily life, why not lie on the warm lavender plains or immerse yourself in the vibrant forests, admiring the moon rising above the clouds, listening to the pure sounds of mountains and streams, and experiencing the ancient notion of "a tranquil heart to view the Way, a silent reflection to forget desires"——the serenity and charm of mountains and waters.

## Structure 
Along the lengthy journey, one encounters not only the moon among the pines but also pavilions and towers, the warmth of hearth fires in homes. As evening falls, why not hoist the sails and steer the boat to moor for the night in a village shrouded in mist, spend a night as a guest, engaging in the simple talk of the villagers, relaxing the weary body. The tension of the journey thus eases. If you come across shrines or temples, ruins or remnants, you might as well pay a visit, explore a bit.**「Harvista」** is equipped with mods like CTOV, Towns and Towers, which create vibrant rurals. Moreover,**「Harvista」** has incorporated many structure mods, bringing a variety of buildings and ruins of different sizes and styles. "When the mountains are high and the waters are wide, you doubt if there's a path ahead; but then among the dim willows and bright flowers, another village appears." When you meet new structures, why not venture boldly inward? Who knows what treasures might await?

## Vanilla+ 
Exploration and construction, the heart of Minecraft's gameplay, is the magical charm that has kept it enduring. As a pack that stays true to the original style, **「Harvista」** integrates its mods seamlessly into Minecraft, for the original Minecraft holds a unique allure all its own.**「Harvista」** preserves the essence of the game while also hoping to evoke the original excitement and intent one felt upon first launching the game.

## Cuisine
After a day of hard work, nothing is more invigorating than enjoying a sumptuous feast. Since ancient times, food and cooking have been an indispensable part of human life, with unique culinary arts in different regions being the treasures of culture. It's a pity that Minecraft's original cooking system is somewhat monotonous, failing to satisfy the players' culinary desires. **「Harvista」** comes with mods Caupona and Farmer's Delight, greatly enhancing the previously plain cooking experience. Traveler, after your long journey, why not enjoy a steaming bowl of rich soup?

## Reliable Optimization
Optimization is not just about Icing on the cake; more importantly, it's about timely helping. A proper optimization, at the very least, should ensure smooth operation on low-end hardware.**「Harvista」** carefully curates optimization mods, integrating them organically to achieve a magical effect of getting more done with less effort. Even a 7-year-old i5-7400 processor with its UHD630 integrated graphics can run the game smoothly at a consistent frame rate.<br />
Moreover, when faced with complex scenes that are high in load and power consumption,**「Harvista」** remains calm. The pack can maintain stable operation even in the later stages of the game, such as in the heart of a factory complex.

## Specifications requirements

## FAQ
**Q. The modpack includes KubeJS, yet it's classified as a native integration. Why is that?**<br />
A. I always believe that the criterion for judging whether a modpack is modified lies in whether it adds new systems on top of the original. Only by adding new content can it be considered an overhaul. In **「Harvista」**, the primary purpose of KubeJS is for compatibility modifications. To me, this may not qualify as an modification. To insist on calling it that would be an insult to those who truly deserve the title. Besides, "one who can express the scene before them and the thoughts in their heart in a single stroke is a creator; there's no need to invoke Tang or Song." The quality of a modpack has little to do with whether it's modified or not.

**Q. I encountered a mysterious error in the game!**<br />
A. I'm sorry to hear that. You can ask for help on Discord with a detailed crash report or issue an issue on GitHub. I'll do my best to answer your questions. However, please refrain from asking questions in the comments, as it's not meaningful.

**Q. The game doesn't crash, but a warning window about missing fonts pops up during startup.**<br />
A. It might be due to insufficient memory allocation. Try increasing the memory allocated to the modpack, or close some background programs if necessary.

**Q. Can I make adaptations of this modpack or create videos about it?**<br />
A. Feel free to do so under the terms of the license agreement.

**Q. I experience significant lag while playing the modpack. What should I do?**<br />
A. I'm sorry to hear that. Please try lowering the game's graphics settings. If your configuration meets the requirements but you still experience lag, please provide feedback on GitHub and Discord.
